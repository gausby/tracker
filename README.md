# Tracker

A (work in progress) BitTorrent Tracker implementation for Elixir.

The tracker supports:

* Tracking of multiple files
* Announce handling
* Scrape handling
* HTTP interface implemented as a Plug
* A completed peer should only get a list incomplete peers

More ideas are welcome.

## Installation

The project will be available on Hex when it is ready. For now it has to be installed by pointing directly to the repo on GitHub.

Please tell me about your experiences using it for something real, and please help out by filling issues and creating pull requests.
